Version 1.3.0.2
	04/24/2011
	* Changed CAVCPropPage::OnReceivedMessage return type from BOOL to INT_PTR.
	  - was causing compile error under VS2010 (overriding virtual method return types don't match)

Version 1.3.0.1
	02/09/2010
	* Increased D2H timeout from (interval between frames + 2 sec) to (interval between frames + 5 sec)

Version 1.3.0.0
	09/22/2009
	* Added try/catch to following code:
	  - around DeleteGraph/CreateGraph in VideoStream::SetValue
	  - MangoStream::OnThreadDestroy
	  - MangoStream::~MangoStream
	  Mantis: 832
	09/21/2009
	* If a MXException with error code (MANGOERROR_SUCCESS - 1) is created, it will be translated to HRESULT 0x8004DEAD.
	  - The HRESULT 0x8004DEAD code should be translated by host applications to indicate that the Mango card cannot be enabled.
	* Added MXException.ToHRESULT method to make sure HRESULTs are computed in a standardized way
	* If the Mango_CardEnable Timeout occurs 10 times, then an MXException with MANGOERROR_SUCCESS - 1 will be thrown.
	  Mantis: 829

Version 1.2.0.1
	05/26/2009
	* Calculate timeout on D2H based on framerate for VideoStream class and descendents

	  Mantis: 1188

Version 1.2.0.0
	01/16/2009
	* Include Frame rate filter at all times, even at 30fps.
	* Interlocked Increment/Decrement on sReferenceCount to try to avoid Create and DeleteGraph races
	* Only try card-enabled-timeout 10 times instead of infinitely
	* Change D2H timeout from FOREVER to 10000ms for time tag and 5000ms for filter buffer
	* Throw exceptions on TimeTag fetch failure
	* Init and Finish methods for the whole mango card are executed only on DLL ATTACH and DETACH
