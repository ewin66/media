﻿===== MediaServer Change Log =====

Version 10.22.1.1
	5/15/2014
	* Code merge and check-in to Future_Concepts (C:\Projects20)
		- lots of project repointing and referencing WinForms controls
		- now in Projects20\Media\CommonControls (was in old AntaresXCommonControls)

Version 10.21.1.10
	4/23/2014
	* Rewrote all the MediaServer WiX Setup Custom Actions (COM Registry Installer, LEADTOOLS License registration)
		using latest WiX Toolset that works for .NET 4.0, which the latest MediaServer depends on.

Version 10.21.1.9
	2/25/2014
	* Remove LEAD H264 Transcoder from MangoDVR Graph (getting unsupported media type)

Version 10.21.1.8

	* Test build with new graph MangoDVR (with LEADTOOLS DVR Sink) and new RTSP Server (using LEADTOOLS RTSP Server/sink)
	darnold

Version 10.21.1.6
	2/6/2014
	* Removed auto-launching of the MediaServerConfigurator from the MediaServer installer
		- this will prevent previous configuration from getting destroyed and
		- will allow an unattended installation using WSUS or msiexec /qn /i MediaServer.msi

Version 10.21.1.5
	12/4/2013
	* Checkpoint build #1 for P260 delivery--get all netmgr/mango support checked-in

Version 10.21.1.4
	12/3/2013
	* Fixes "No Profile Groups Loaded!" exception when loading Mango sources
		- Added [XmlElement] to all public properties in SourceStreamInfo.cs
		- the XmlSerializer behaves better when serializing generic list (List<string>)
	Mantis: 8890

Version 10.21.1.3
	11/21/2013
	* Created a public property for Store in UserPresetStore.  This class was
		recently decorated [DataContract] and the internal store was not exposed 
		for serialization.


Version 10.21.1.2
	11/6/2013
	* bug fixes
	darnold

Version 10.21.1.1
	11/4/2013
	* Major changes to SVD/MediaServer WCF contract
		- SVD 10.21.1.1 and MediaServer 10.21.1.1 must be tested together.
		- SVD 10.21.1.1 will not work with a version of MediaServer prior to 10.21.1.1
	darnold

Version 10.20.1.4
	4/17/2013
	* Added more sleep between SmartCaptureSDK.SC* calls during graph setup
	darnold

Version 10.20.1.3
	* Reset FastVDO before graph is started
	* Show messages for release builds (was using Debug.WriteLine; should be AppLogger.Message)

Version 10.20.1.2
	* Added PushFVSC to SourceType and BaseGraph.CreateInstance()
	darnold

Version 10.20.1.1
	* NOTE: This release of MediaServer is only compatible with SVD 10.20.*
		there are some contract changes.
	* Added support for MPEG2 Transport push streams (SinkProtocolType.UDP_MPEG2_TS)
		- this will be used to push video from AntaresX Media Server to WOWZA Media Server
			for restreaming purposes.
		- Push streams will always run even if no clients are connected to 
			AntaresX MediaServer if 
		- Uses 2 new LEADTOOLS DirectShow filters:
			* LEAD MPEG2 Transport Multiplexer
			* LEAD MPEG2 Transport UDP Sink
		- new UDPStreamingGraph, which PushFastVDO and PushBouncingBall derive
		- Reorganization of MediaServer configuration
			- Profile no longer define protocols or addresses; profiles just
				define encoder properties (bitrate, framerate, key frame rate, size, etc.)
			- Added 2 new configuration items to Sources.XML (StreamSourceInfo)
				- SinkURL (defines the WOWZA server input address)--this URL
					is only used for push sources.  Example: udp://205.129.7.56:8000
				- ClientURL (defines the address SVD uses to pull the stream)
					Example: rtsp://205.129.7.56:1935/live/fastvdo.stream
	* Changed MediaServerConfigurator to allow modifying new properties
	* Added "ProfileChangesAllowed" property to source configuration.
		- If ProfileChangesAllowed=false, SVD will not allow the user
			to view or modify the profile group selector.

Version 10.19.7.16
	* Use ILMNetMux instead of LMNetMux

Version 10.19.7.15
	* Comment-out "MaxQueueDuration=SourceConfig.MaxQueueDuration"--I have a hunch this may
		be the issue.  This property is defined as a LONG in the LEADTOOLS documentation, but
		the COM interface has it defined as a double.

Version 10.19.7.14
	2/19/2013
	* Rebuild with ErrorLogger built Debug--everything else built Release

Version 10.19.7.13
	1/3/2013
	* Fix bug causing RTSP graph from throwing exception
	darnold

Version 10.19.7.12
	1/3/2012
	* Fix WiX setup project issues.  I needed to re-pointed references in the WiX setup project
		- and that caused issues because the reference needed the property "Harvest" set to true.
		"Harvest" is used by the Wix HEAT tool to implicitly include the reference in the MSI.
	darnold

Version 10.19.7.11
	12/27/2012
	* Added support for Ubiquity AirCam IP Camera
		- refactored graphs and created RTSPGraph, which uses LEADTOOLS RTSP Source filter
	* Attempt to fix crash found in surveyor WCF trace log:
		FutureConcepts.Media.Server.GraphManager.RemoveAndDisposeGraph(BaseGraph graph)
		FutureConcepts.Media.Server.IndigoServices.CommonStreamService.SetProfile(Profile newProfile)
		FutureConcepts.Media.Server.IndigoServices.StreamService.SetProfile(Profile newProfile)
		SyncInvokeSetProfile(Object , Object[] , Object[] )

		Unable to cast COM object of type 'LMNetSnkLib.LMNetSnkClass' to interface type 'LMNetSnkLib.ILMNetSnk'. This operation failed because the QueryInterface call on the COM component for the interface with IID '{E2B7DE6E-38C5-11D5-91F6-00104BDB8FF9}' failed due to the following error: No such interface supported (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80004002 (E_NOINTERFACE)).
	darnold

Version 10.19.7.10
	* Fix build error (use Release was Debug)

Version 10.19.7.9
	* Added CustomProfileEnabled to ProfileGroup
		- setting to "false" will disable the custom profile trackbars/buttons in SVD
	* Added LEADTOOLS V17.5 modules 
	* Updated LEADTOOLS License module to include new license keys
	* Removed WixCustomActionExtension module from MediaServerSetup WiX Project.  
		- this module was causing the MediaServer deployment build from failing
		- according to Kevin, this is something he started and didn't finish.

Version 10.19.7.8
	07/27/2011
	* Create Output Directory before writing to it when saving channels (StreamingTVGraph.SaveKnownChannels())

	kdixon

Version 10.19.7.2
	03/25/2011
	* Implement Link Quality polling on MicrowaveControlService2
	* Build against MicrowaveReceiverController 2.0.2.1
	  - various Vislink HDR1000 improvements
	  - Link Quality polling support
	kdixon

Version 10.19.7.1
	03/18/2011
	* Vislink HDR1000 improvements
	  - proper reading of "hdec" parameter
	  - disabled custom ReceiveUntil, may be causing SafeHandleClosed

	kdixon

Version 10.19.7.0
	02/02/2011-03/07/2011
	* Add MicrowaveControlService2
	* Update MicrowaveControlService to use new data structures from MicrowaveReceiverController
	  on the backend. Transparent change to clients of this service.
	* ServerConfigService forces advertised MicrowaveControlInfo.Type to PMR_AR100 so as not
	  to cause older clients to fail populating the server's info
	kdixon

Version 10.19.6.2
	01/27/2011
	* Throw source config exception if DeviceAddress construct is missing before derefrencing it.
	  Mantis: 2876
	* Disable ROT entry creation for BaseGraph -- define symbol DEBUG_ROTENTRY to re-enable
	  - causing security exceptions
	* FastVDO graph -- changed "throw exc" to "throw"
	01/26/2011
	* Make config and user data use the AntaresXData system
	  - Config is stored in %StaticSettings%/MediaServer
	  - User data is stored in %Settings%/Output/MediaServer
	    Mantis: 2634
	kdixon

Version 10.19.6.1
	01/25/2011
	* Finished rebuild in new installer, SUPPORT_SRM314 is defined by default.
	kdixon

Version 10.19.6.0
	01/14/2011
	* Rebuilt for VS2010 and .NET 4
	* Removed support for Sensoray SRM314 -- define symbol SUPPORT_SRM314 if you want to include it
	kdixon

Version 10.19.5.0
	04/21/2010
	* Update for compatability with WSUS
	  - Media Server Configurator 10.19.2.0
	  - RegistrationInstallHelper 1.0.0.2
	  Mantis: 2033
	* Built against MediaClient 1.3.1.0 -- no more support for the old ServerConfigService
	  - WCF binding is still going to be present until a new version of SVD with this MediaClient
	    has been shipped to all clients
	  Mantis: 2142
	* Built with PowerSupplyController 1.2.0.1
	* Change to make the GraphManager..ctor fail safe. Under some low-memory conditions the constructor
	  can fail to create the graph stash timer. Even if we lose this functionality, it will let the application
	  at least limp along
	kdixon

Version 10.19.4.2
	02/16/2010
	* Rebuilt for Client 1.3.0.3 to fix error loading qms_config.xml (it was looking in System32)
	kdixon

Version 10.19.4.1
	02/16/2010
	* Rebuilt for Client 1.3.0.2 for fix to ServerConfig client
	  Mantis: 2001
	kdixon

Version 10.19.4.0
	02/10 - 02/12/2010
	* Added new binding for ServerConfigService, endpoint is localhost:8099/ServerConfig and uses the ReliableSession NetTcpBinding
	  Mantis: 1941
	* If a ServiceHost faults, a record is kept of the number of times it faults.
	  - The app.config key "IndigoServicesHostMaxFaults" configures how many times a particular ServiceHost may fault
	    before the MediaServer process kills itself. Set to 0 to disable the fault limit.
	  Mantis: 1995
	kdixon

Version 10.19.3.1
	02/09/2010
	* Raise GraphControlClientSendTimeout to 30 (from 20) to match SVD.
	  Should aid in completing connections to origin servers.
	kdixon

Version 10.19.3.0
	02/09/2010
	* Moved ServerNeedsPowerCycle support from GraphManager to MediaServer class.
	* Moved Suicide support from BaseGraph to MediaServer
	* Removed HTTP GET support from ServerConfigService (RESTPOXBinding).
	* WebStreamService changes
	  - configured via app.config instead of hard coded
	  - new endpoint "ServerInfo", replaces ServerConfigService RESTPOXBinding
	    - accepts URI parameters "server" and "source", in format "ServerInfo?[server=X]&[source=Y]"
	      These parameters correspond to serverParams and sourceParams on ServerConfigService.GetServerInfoSpecific.
	      If they are null, then they are ignored, and all fields are returned
	  - new endpoint "clientaccesspolicy.xml" to support querying of server by Silverlight clients. Currently returns
	    a permissive access policy (all endpoints available). In the future, this could be extended to read from
	    a file so a sysadmin could control this.
	* Moved ServerStatusService to 8097 and re-enabled.
	  Re: Mantis: 1941
	* Includes MangoCapture 1.3.0.1 -- Increased D2H timeout to frame interval + 5 seconds.
	* Media Server Configurator 10.19.1.0
	* Update to QueryMediaServers -- uses qms_config.xml in root folder
	kdixon

Version 10.19.2.1
	02/05/2010
	* When MXE_E_Timeout or MXE_E_Fail is received from the Mango graph during a ChangeProfile operation,
	  it will translate that into a ServerGraphRebuildException
	  Mantis: 1974
	* Added code to WinTV418ATSC to respect the DeviceIndex configuration parameter so it will work in multi-card systems.
	  Mantis: 1975
	kdixon

Version 10.19.2.0
	01/12/2010 - 01/25/2010
	* Completed LTRestreamer2
	  - If the client count drops to 0, then there is a 60 second (app.config key "LTRestreamerStopDelay")
		window before the MS drops the origin connection. This way if the client of the restreamer is having
		a lossy time, it should hopefully come back within 1 minute, so the connection to the origin will already be open.
	  - Unnecessary reconnects to the origin are avoided, and should only occur if the origin connection faults,
	    or a ServerGraphRebuild occurs on the origin.
	  - Also the GMFBridge has buffering enabled, this also improves the probability that a media type mismatch
	    will actually go through (the GMFBridge will re-negotiate within limits).
	  Mantis: 1942
	kdixon

Version 10.19.1.4
	01/22/2010
	* Fix issue where LTRestreamer would do the StopDeferred, but never start again
	kdixon
	
Version 10.19.1.3
	01/13/2010
	* Disable ServerStatusService and RecordService
	kdixon

Version 10.19.1.2
	01/12/2010
	* Fix for FastVDO constructor to call Dispose when falling out of the constructor
	* Added Stop-deferrment to LTRestreamer.
	* New app.config appSettings keys
	  - "UseLTRestreamer2" set to TRUE to use LTRestreamer2, or false to use LTRestreamer
	    - default false
	  - "LTRestreamerStopDelay" set the time to defer stopping in ms for LTRestreamer and LTRestreamer2
	    - default 60000
	01/06/2010
	* Added some work towards LTRestreamer2 / OriginClientGraph2. These use on MediaDSGraphs library,
	  and are working towards hot swapping the source to a test pattern when the origin is not connected
	01/05/2010
	* Fix issue where WebRestreamer could not instantiate graphs
	  Mantis: 1917
	* Updated to work with latest PowerSupplyController library
	kdixon

Version 10.19.1.1
	12/??/2009
	* Low-Memory test build. Changes reverted
	kdixon

Version 10.19.1.0
	10/19/2009 - 10/27/2009
	* Completed support for Sensoray M314.
	  - link against new library SRM314HWProxy
	* CameraControlService changes the way it controls access to PTZ control through the ResourceManager.
	  - locks are performed against the combination of typeof(CameraControlService) and the
	    sourceConfig.CameraControl.Address property. This allows multiple sources to share control of
	    the same camera and indicate what user is currently useing the camera, regardless of the
	    source they are connected to.
	  - old behavior was to lock against source name. This is still a fall-back if CameraControl.Address is null/empty
	kdixon

Version 10.19.0.4
	10/15/2009
	* Added some sleeping to the LTRestreamer when origin connect attempts fail, should improve 
	  performance of other threads

Version 10.19.0.3
	10/14/2009
	* Most features of Sensoray314 board are implemeneted -- not official yet though
	* Built against latest PowerSupplyController library
	kdixon

Version 10.19.0.2
	10/06/2009
	* Include LMVYUVxf.dll transform filter, should allow 4CIF YUV to render
	  Mantis: 1707
	kdixon

Version 10.19.0.1
	10/01/2009
	* Update to ServerConfigService to support Hidden property
	kdixon

Version 10.19.0.0
	09/30/2009
	* Completed StreamStatusService
	09/28/2009

	* Ships with MSC 10.18.1.1 -- fixes some install time isseus
	kdixon

Version 10.18.6.0
	09/22/2009
	* Support detection of dead mango. If MangoCapture returns HRESULT 0x8004DEAD then we know the mango card
	  cannot be enabled and needs to be power cycled.
	  - Mango.cs implements this feature by calling to the PowerSupplyController to schedule a de-power and re-power.
	    It also calls SystemShutdown service to halt windows gracefully (should be able to occur before the de-power
	    timer executes)
	* Ships with MangoCapture 1.3.0.0
	  Mantis: 829, 832
	kdixon

Version 10.18.5.4
	09/17/2009
	* Media Server Configurator 10.18.0.10 -- fixes install time problems with FVSC-HQSource

	kdixon

Version 10.18.5.3
	09/16/2009
	* FastVDO hardware settings while in MJPEG mode can be controlled via the profile group FVSC-HQSource.
	  - The default profile for the group will be used.
	kdixon

Version 10.18.5.2
	09/16/2009
	* Tweak FastVDO hardware settings for better MJPEG performance on portables
	kdixon

Version 10.18.5.1

Version 10.18.4.3
	07/06/2009
	* Updated Still Frames profile group in the template data
	  Mantis: 1420
	kdixon

Version 10.18.4.2
	07/01/2009
	* Built against Media 1.1.0.9
	* WinTVAnalogBase now defaults to TVMode.Satellite, since there are no longer analog channels.
	  - if there is a channel scan in progress, it must complete, but then if there are no users connected
	    to the graph, it is reset to TVMode.Satellite when someone joins.
	  Mantis: 1372
	kdixon

Version 10.18.4.1

	  Mantis: 1107
	kdixon

Version 10.18.3.1
	06/10/2009
	* If QueryOriginServers detects a change in the origin servers, it will change the ServerInfo.RevisionNumber
	kdixon

	06/05/2009
	* LTRestreamer will cause a ServerGraphRebuild if the origin changes SinkProtocol or VideoCodec
	06/04/2009
	* Changed LTRestreamer to auto-match its SinkProtocol based on the origin's SinkProtocol, if the default profile's
	  SinkProtocol is set to "Default". This behavior was shown to improve performance in testing.
	kdixon

Version 10.18.2.0
	06/03/2009
	* Changed TV graphs to use a WCF callback instead of LMNetMux messages to announce the current channel and channel changes
	* Actually fixes problem where TV Graphs would try to cache their known channels in the windows\system32 folder.
	  Mantis: 1198
	* Changed template_data to include HDTV sources, and changes Restreamer:Default profile to UDP.
	kdixon

Version 10.18.1.2
	05/27/2009
	* Changed CameraControlService to support camera control plugins that use their own preset caching mechanism
	  Mantis: 1183
	05/26/2009
	* Built against MangoCapture 1.2.0.1, which calculates its timeouts dynamically, based on frame rate.
	  Resolves Mantis: 1188
	* Built with Configurator 10.18.0.2
	  Mantis: 1190, 1191
	kdixon

Version 10.18.1.1

	* Fixes problem where TV graphs try to cache their known channels in the windows\system32 folder
	  Mantis: 1198
	* Fixed issue where restreamer would not populate version information from origin servers.
	  Mantis: 1187
	kdixon

Version 10.18.1.0
	05/20/2009
	* new Profile Group "Still Frames" -- template configuration includes this on all FVSC and MX sourcetypes.
	* "Still Frames" profile removed from EVDO-related profile groups.
	* Template configuration makes Still Frames profile group the default profile group
	* Includes FC Frame Rate Filter 1.0.1.0
	kdixon

Version 10.18.0.2
	05/15/2009
	* Improvements to the Configurator
	  - Configurator asks if you want to start the service at install time
	* Make shortcut to the configurator in the Start menu.
	kdixon

Version 10.18.0.1
	05/11/2009
	* Added support for RelinquishTimer field in MicrowaveControlInfo
	kdixon

Version 10.18.0.0
	02/06/2009
	* Removed IndigoServices.SourceControlService
	01/30/2009
	* Network TV is channel-scannable
	01/23/2009
	* Implemented broadcasting of current Channel via InBandData to clients.
	* Ditched all the old TV Channel/Station/Lineup info
	* Some changes to BaseGraph
	kdixon

Version 10.17.3.3
	05/05/2009
	* Support for Wonwoo WCA 261 camera (PTZType.WWCA)
	kdixon

Version 10.17.3.2
	04/23/2009
	* Removed support for symbols SHOW_CLOSING and SHOW_OPENING -- these actions are always reported to AppLogger.Message
	* Implemented ServceHost restarting mechansim for faulted services.
	kdixon

Version 10.17.3.1
	04/13/2009
	* Fixed problem where Mango graphs would never set their image size.
	  Mantis: #1091
	kdixon

Version 10.17.3.0
	04/06/2009
	* Renamed "NetSource" to "LTRestreamer"
	* Converted LTRestreamer to use GMFBridge. Downstream clients will not be affected if origin server is rebuilding, etc...
	  They will just see a freeze in the picture. Resolves issues with subsequent connections.
	  Mantis: #754
	* Added support to Restreamer for 10.17 connection semantics
	  Mantis: #718
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.7
	04/01/2009
	* Add references to projects instead of DLLs for MS Configurator.
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.6
	03/09/2009
	* Removed dependency on ksivac15 DirectShow filter
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.5
	03/04/2009
	* built against latest MediaClient for Network library fix
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.4
	02/18/2009
	* built against CameraControls 1.0.4.1 / fixes Mantis 890
	* built against MediaClient 1.0.6.2
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.3
	01/27/2009
	* Changed the Mango graph ChangeProfile implementation to set KeyFrameRate before FrameRate and ConstantBitRate. This causes
	  the Mango to properly configure its encoder, instead of using the "last known" KFR when initializing the encoder.
	  Mantis: 860
	* Link against new CameraContols 1.0.4.0, includes updated WonwooWCC261 plugin
	  Mantis: 638
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.2
	01/23/2009
	* Added writes to the Application Event Log when a graph is hung, and when the process kills itself.
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.1
	01/21/2009
	* Added code to the ProjectInstaller.cs to set the Recovery parameters of the service.
	01/20/2009
	* Added symbol USE_GRAPH_STATELOCK. When this symbol is defined, there is locking in place per-Graph on the Run, Stop and Abort methods.
	  This should alleviate hangs due to multiple threads calling Run and/or Stop at the same time.
	  When Run and Stop are executing at the same time, it can destroy the state of the MangoCapture.dll
	01/16/2009
	* Changed code in BaseGraph.Run and Stop to disable the abort timer if an exception is thrown.
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.0
	01/16/2009
	* Always use FrameRateFilter in MangoCapture, even @ 30fps - appears to fix 30fps crash (see Kevin)
	* Try MangoX_CardEnable 10 times, then throw MangoXException if all attempts fail.  Previously it tried forever.
	* Fix possible (but unlikely) race condition in Mango.cpp.  Use InterlockedIncrement() on sReferenceCount.
	* Added 5 second timeout on TimeTag reads in MangoStream.cpp (MangoCapture).  
	Mantis: 829, 832
	darnold
	* Exception is thrown if no port in the $PortRange macro can be selected.
	kdixon
	
Version 10.17.1.3
	01/16/2009
	* Adds preliminary support for HDTV streaming over network.
	kdixon

Version 10.17.1.2
	01/14/2009
	* If symbol SUICIDE_ON_DSHANG is defined, then the media server will kill its own process when a DirectShow hang needs to be
	  aborted.
	  Mantis: 819
	kdixon

Version 10.17.1.1
	01/13/2009
	* Disabled abort implementation
	  Mantis: 819
	kdixon

Version 10.17.1.0
	01/12/2009
	* added watchdog/abort timer to both Run and Stop implementations of BaseGraph. This should allow the Media Server
	  higher availablility and recoverability from bad errors at the DirectShow level.
	 Mantis: 819
	kdixon

Version 10.17.0.3
	01/05/2009
	* added BaseGraph.BuildSinkURL method to get templated SinkURL to be expanded as needed
	  Mantis: 775
	* Changed BaseGraph.ClientList to fetch users for CommonStreamService instead of just StreamService
	  Mantis: 750
	* Changed "PanTilt Roof" to "Roof Pan/Tilt/Zoom" in source description template data
	kdixon

Version 10.17.0.2
	01/02/2009
	* Replaced the guts of QueryOriginServers with the Client.QueryMediaServers class (require MediaClient 1.0.4.0)
	* set the mask on QueryMediaServers.RequestedStreamSourceInfoParams to exclude CameraControl info
	  Mantis: 348
	* Changed the app.config for ReliableSession128 to have an inactivityTimeout of 40 seconds. This will help compensate for
	  both high latency conditions, and the possiblity of "missing" 1 keep alive.
	kdixon

Version 10.17.0.1
	12/31/2008 - 01/02/2009
	* Clients send struct ClientConnectRequest. The Server then uses that struct to create an OpenGraphRequest which is
	  only used to call the constructor of a graph.
	   - Moved Media.OpenGraphRequest to Media.Server.OpenGraphRequest
	* Fixes problem where ServerGraphRebuild would cause the graph to get constructed with the default profile
	  Mantis: 753
	kdixon

Version 10.17.0.0
	12/31/2008
	* added Antares icon to installer
	  Mantis: 765
	kdixon
	12/30/2008
	* Added Reconnect() method to IStream and the StreamService.
	* Removed the ProfileName hack to determine if client was reconnecting.
	darnold

Version 10.16.0.7
	12/24/2008
	* re-enabled USE_GLOBAL_GRAPHSERVICELOCK
	* updated SHOW_ADDCLIENTS symbol to show total clients after each action.
	kdixon

Version 10.16.0.6
	12/22/2008
	* Media Server Configurator 1.0.1.2
	  Mantis: 728
	* Disabled FastVDO multiple-self-retry. It drops the connection after "1" retry, which reverts to old behavior (pre 10.16.0.1).
	  Mantis: 722
	* Added "<serviceThrottling maxConcurrentSessions="100"/>" to the behavior "OurDefaultBehavior" in the app.config.
	  Mantis: 720, 359
	* Added symbol SHOW_ADDCLIENTS for compilation, which shows when BaseGraph.AddClient and RemoveClient are called
	kdixon

Version 10.16.0.5
	12/17/2008
	* Moved WinTV graph from Server.WinTV to Server.Graphs.WinTV
	* EVDO-TCP:Poor Signal had its framerate set to 15fps instead of 20fpm.
	  Mantis: 713
	* Renamed some items in EVDO and EVDO-TCP to be more clear
	  - old scale: Poor Signal, Super Low, Low, Medium, High
	  - new scale: Still Frames, Low, Medium-Low, Medium, High
	* Removed Zap2It entries from app.config
	* Added keys to app.config / appSettings
	  - DispatchClientsUpdate (bool) Controls StreamingGraph.SendClientUpdate
	  - DispatchProfileUpdate (bool) Controls StreamingGraph.SendProfileUpdate
	kdixon

Version 10.16.0.4
	12/15/2008
	* Fixes to default Config data so all UDP ports are in the range.
	  Mantis: 665
	* Media Server Configurator 1.0.1.1
	kdixon

Version 10.16.0.3
	12/05/2008
	* Altered app.config to avoid doing runtime checks against Certificate Revocation List. Improves startup time.
	kdixon

Version 10.16.0.2
	12/02/2008
	* Disabled service-wide lock on CommonStreamService.OpenGraph and SetProfile. It can be re-enabled by defining USE_GLOBAL_GRAPHSERVICELOCK
	Mantis: 604 (hopefully)
	12/03/2008
	* Removed cruft files (app.config configurations for pre Sources.xml era)
	* In BaseGraph.AddClient, moved the lock to only cover the list-altering operation. Run() is now outside the lock, so that even if that call blocks,
	  the streams can still operate on the list, which should keep the server more responsive.
	kdixon

Version 10.16.0.1
	11/21/2008
	* Fixed issue where any profile change would cause a re-buffering
	darnold
	11/24/2008
	* FastVDO now does 4 retries on resetting itself per connect. If the 4 try fails, then it fails the connection, causing
	  the server to destroy the graph, which causes SVD to re-initiate a connect attempt.
	kdixon

Version 10.16.0.0
	11/03/2008 - 11/17/2008
	* WebRestreamer added. Configure a source called "webrestreamer" to activate it.
	  Mantis: 362
	* Changed the way that MediaServer determines if it is a Restreamer. It now determines if there are any sources of type Restreamer.
	  If so, it starts the QueryOriginServers thread. These are listed.
	* MediaServer writes its version information to the Debug console whether or not it is in debug mode
	kdixon
	11/17/2008 - 11/20/2008
	* For new OpenGraph() requests, reset profile to defaultprofile, not just when client count > 1
	  Mantis: 602
	* Fixed a bug where OpenGraph() could throw an uncaught ServerGraphRebuildException
	* added SuperLow profiles (32kbps) to EVDO and EVDO-TCP
	darnold
	11/20/2008
	* Added method GetServerInfoSpecific (and supporting methods) to lower bandwidth usage for multiple subsequent calls to GetServerInfo
	  Mantis: 542
	kdixon

Version 10.15.2.0
	10/29/2008 - 10/31/2008
	* Restreamer works. It queries servers via the normal GetAdvertisedServices. If a server is configured as a restreamer,
	  then it will restream any video source it can find. When a restreamer is connected, you will see the user "Restreamer (<IP>)"
	  connected to the source.
	* Added MediaServerConfigurator to installer.
		- This eliminates the process of editing the Sources.xml file after install.
		- If you run the installer, and select "Repair" you can install a different configuration.
		- The Media Server Configurator is also installed, so you can use it to edit the server's configuration.
			Please use the application with care, as it has not been thoroughly tested.
	kdixon
	
Version 10.15.1.0
	10/01/2008
	* Change to Server.IndigoServices.CameraControlService
	  - Requested pan/tilt/zoom values are limited based on the configured Capabilities
	  instead of the universal degrees system.
	  - Now plugins must update their CurrentPanAngle, CurrentTiltAngle, and CurrentZoomLevel as they're being invoked.
	* Built against CameraControls 1.0.3.0. Fixes Mantis #451
	  Mantis: 451
	* Adds support for WonwooWCC261 camera control
	kdixon

		
Version 10.15.0.2
	09/12/2008
	* (darnold) Removed lock(graphServiceLock) in CommonStreamService.KeepAlive()
		this might have been causing a backlog of queued one-way requests.
	* (darnold) Removed erroneous call to GraphManager.RemoveGraph() in 
		CommonStreamService.OpenGraph().  This might have been causing
		two running server graphs connected to the same source or a MS crash.
	* (darnold) Check Graph.NumberOfClients against Config.MaxClients.
		If a connect request is made on a source that is at the limit,
		the MS will now throw the new SourceHasMaxClientsException().
		SVD will catch this exception and stop the connection process.
	* (darnold) Set MaxClients to 4 for: surveyor1, Vid1, Vid2, Vid3, Vid4.

Version 10.15.0.1
	09/12/2008
	* (darnold) Removed some SourceType's that were no longer being used
	* (darnold) use new SourceType.Restreamer
	* (darnold) Changed StreamService port from 8099 to 8098 to isolate it
		from other services
	* (darnold) Created custom binding for StreamService so that maxPendingChannels
		could be configured
		Mantis: 359
