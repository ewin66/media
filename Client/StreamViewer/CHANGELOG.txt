﻿==== FutureConcepts.Media.Client.StreamViewer ====

Version 1.2.5.4
	01/16/2013
	* Added recording capabilities to RTSP Streams to support Ubiquiti AirCam
	darnold

Version 1.2.5.3
	06/08/2011
	* Change references to Interop.LMNetDmx2 and Interop.LMNetSrc2 to LEADTOOLS 17
	kdixon

Version 1.2.5.2
	03/18/2011
	* Change references to Interop.LMNetDmx2 and Interop.LMNetSrc2 to LEADTOOLS 15
	kdixon

Version 1.2.5.1
	02/03/2011
	* Build against DirectShowLib 2.1.0.1
	* Fix potential debug assertion in connectWorker (_graph == null) if an exception occurs in DSGraph.Dispose on the previous connect attempt
	kdixon

Version 1.2.5.0
	04/08/2010
	* Changed SourceControlTypeStateTracker to not change a type's state away from Active if the
	  target state is Enabled, since Active implies that it is already Enabled.
	  Mantis: 2106
	* Fixed issue where recordings would not start properly
	  - also changed the default values of RecordingsPath and SnapshotPath to the "C:\AntaresXData" versions
	  Mantis: 2123
	* Changes to resolve Mantis 2107
	  - Changed iconBusy to be implemented with a PictureBox instead of a Label. The PictureBox plays nicer with the ImageAnimator
	  - Changed Disposal threading strategy.
	  Mantis: 2107
	kdixon

Version 1.2.4.1
	02/06/2010
	* SVC throws an execption in StartLocalGraph if the SinkURL is null or empty.
	  - this invokes a sleep, so when connecting to an LTRestreamer2 it will show the status
	    Connecting instead of Buffering when the restreamer is still preparing.
	  Mantis: 1959
	* Tidy up some disposal routines to avoid potential memory leak when performing a large number
	  of connect/disconnect cycles
	kdixon

Version 1.2.4.0
	10/13/2009
	* Adds support to select proper decoder for VideoCodecType.MJPEG streams
	kdixon

Version 1.2.3.3
	10/06/2009
	* Added some more robustness to the Dispose method. Errors from disabling/stopping the iconBusy
	  should be trapped without faulting the disconnect procedure. This should prevent the server
	  getting filled with users when someone with 4 clients closes the app.
	  Mantis: 1730
	kdixon

Version 1.2.3.2
	09/29/2009
	* Fixes issue where StreamViewer can get stuck in the stopping state.
	  - if a profile change is occuring (e.g. the connectWorker is not in charge), initing a connect
	    to a source will put the viewer in stopping state, but will not transition back.
	  - updated Stop method to take this scenario into account
	  Mantis: 1708
	* StreamViewerControl checks the app.config value "StreamViewerRecordingEnabled" -- if set to false, it
	  does not display the record and snapshot buttons.
	  Mantis: 1720
	* Remove reference to WindowsMediaLib
	kdixon

Version 1.2.3.1
	09/03/2009
	* Cleaned up some unused members on DSGraph
	* Updated all documentation/comments
	kdixon

Version 1.2.3.0
	07/22/2009
	* Changed class SourceControlTypeEnabledTracker to SourceControlTypeStateTracker
	  - adds support for 5 states per source control type
	  -- Active : control is currently in use
	  -- Inactive : control is not currently in use, but is available to the user
	  -- Enabled : user is allowed to use control. If the StreamViewerControl *has* such a control, this state is promoted to Inactive
	  -- Disabled : user is not allowed to use control.
	  -- Unavailable : no such control exists for the current StreamViewerControl
	* When clicked, a Source Control's state goes to Disabled to prevent the user from changing the state while it is trying to transition
	  from Inactive to Active.
	kdixon

Version 1.2.2.2
	07/20/2009
	* Fixes problem where if you dropped a new connection onto a Buffering SVC, it would be ignored.
	* Improved IllegalStateTransition handler, should not crash the AppDomain now
	* Stricter State Transition rules -- removed "legal" transitions that cannot happen
	kdixon

Version 1.2.2.1
	07/15/2009
	* Corrects typo on single/4 way button's tooltip
	  Mantis: 1508
	kdixon

Version 1.2.2.0
	07/15/2009
	* Fixes problem where Thumbnail.IconFilename was referencing the wrong path
	  Mantis: 1501
	* Thumbnail releases mouse capture right before it raises the DragStarted event, this was interfereing
	  with the DragDropManager
	  related to Mantis: 1500
	* Added guards on the BackgroundWorkers to prevent running them while they are busy -- this may mean that
	  the BW is waiting to execute, but is locked on the connectMutex
	  Mantis: 1497
	* Explicitly call the ImageAnimator.StopAnimate method for iconBusy in the Dispose method
	  Mantis: 1263
	kdixon

Version 1.2.1.0
	07/08/2009
	* Added marshalling code in Dispose method to ensure SVC is being disposed on the proper thread
	  Mantis: 1443
	* Added fix to abort connection sequence if a SourceHasMaxClientsException is detected
	  Mantis: 1444
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.9
	07/01/2009
	* Added a check during a ServerGraphRebuild to see if the control has been requested to stop.
	  Mantis: 1384
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.8
	06/10/2009
	* Moved code to remove image from iconBusy to be first thing in Dispose method
	  Mantis: 1263
	* Took out latent code that causes disconnect if an exception's message contains the word "abort"
	  Mantis: 1265
	* Cleaned up profile negotiation code to use SessionDescription's new convienence methods
	* Added locking when calling methods on IVMRWindowlessControl, should prevent "Race on RCW Cleanup" during DSGraph.Disposal

Version 1.2.0.7
	06/04/2009
	* Changed ConnectionChainDescriptor.GetDescription to put the source name first.
	  Mantis: 1260
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.6
	05/27/2009
	* Fixed issue where ServerAddress property was returning OriginServer instead of HostServer.
	  Mantis: 1214
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.5
	05/20/2009
	* Allow transition from Buffering to Connecting
	* Fixed problem where ServerGraphRebuild would cause all clients to re-OpenGraph instead of Reconnect
	  Mantis: 1132
	* Fixed problem where connectWorker would try to set state to Connecting while disconnectWorker was stopping
	  - Moved CheckConnectCancelled before any action is taken in the connectWorker_DoWork
	* Fixed problem where SVC would Stop after it succeeded after retrying a connection more than once
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.4
	05/18/2009
	* Implemented an instance mutex on the DSGraph class to prevent concurrent modification
	05/15/2009
	* Added tool-tips to busy indicator for start palette
	  Mantis: 1170
	* Fixed control button staying enabled even if it fails to load
	  Mantis: 1167
	* Fixed buttons getting covered by label in small resolutions. Label is now Docked Fill.
	  Mantis: 1162
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.3
	05/11/2009
	* new graphics for FullScreen button
	* Added "busy" indicator
	* All connection, WCF and DirectShow is handled in the "connectWorker"
	* Stopping/Disconnection is handled in the "disconnectWorker"
	* Fixed state behavior for Multi-threaded approach
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.2
	05/08/2009
	* Re-named FullView to SingleView.
	* SingleView behaves similarly to FullScreen. The parent application can use the SingleView property to track its state.
	  Mantis: 181
	* SingleView and FullScreen properties now update their tool tips.
	* Changed tool-tip to show in 50ms and re-show in 10ms for better feeling
	* new graphics for SingleView button
	kdixon	

Version 1.2.0.1
	05/07/2009
	* Removed repaint/resize batching, it was causing crashes
	  Mantis: 1135
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.0
	02/04/2009
	* Added button for PTZ control
	* Added button for Microwave control
	* Implemented repaint/resize batching for when the sliding panel was moving to improve performance
	kdixon

Version 1.1.2.5
	04/13/2009
	* Cleaned up Snapshot class. Fixed naming conventions and removed unneccesary methods. Also removed resizing logic.
	  Mantis: 232
	* Cleaned up code in StreamViewerControl
	* Standardized file names for snapshots and recordings to show friendly name of server and description of
	  source instead of IP and SourceName
	* A Snapshot is no longer generated for a recording. This may lessen the frequency of Mantis #229, needs testing.
	kdixon

Version 1.1.2.4
	04/08/2009
	* Fixes an issue where if SetProfileOnServer failed to reach the server, the graph would die. If this happens,
	  we perform a reconnect.
	  Mantis: 1073
	* Displays the restreamer's name if the stream is being restreamed
	  Mantis: 716
	kdixon

Version 1.1.2.3
	01/26/2009
	* Fixed problem where JIT compiler would not enter the method to post a new snapshot to Tactical Planning.
	  This would cause the SVC to get stuck in "Snapshot" mode. This problem was caused by a change to the Utilities.Win32
	  library class. The code calling into that class was updated to work with the latest version.
	  Additionally, the code that reverts the state of the SVC to the proper state was put in a finally block so
	  subsequent errors like this cannot occur.
	  Mantis: 857
	kdixon

Version 1.1.2.2
	01/21/2009
	* Deleted "toolTip1" control from StreamViewerControl. The stream description's tooltip is now bound using "tt" as the other
	  controls are.
	  Mantis: 834
	* Deleted image lists for old "+" and "-" buttons
	kdixon

Version 1.1.2.1
	01/02/2009
	* Cleaned cruft out of Thumbnail control
	kdixon

Version 1.1.2.0
	12/31/2008
	* StreamViewer correctly stops the background connection worker, disposes the graph, and prevents a new graph from
	  being created when the Stop method is called.
	  - the BackgroundWorker _loadServerWorker is no longer disposed and created between attempts.
	Mantis: 719
	kdixon
	12/30/2008
	* StreamViewer now calls the new IStream.Reconnect() for reconnect attempts instead of the Profile hack
	darnold

Version 1.1.1.2
	12/24/2008 *CHRISTMAS EVE EDITION*
	* Added a case for Stop being called while Buffering. This should correctly dispose the graph
	  Mantis: 719
	* added FullViewClickedEventArgs, which is passed when the Full View button is clicked.
	  Mantis: 764
	kdixon

Version 1.1.1.1
	12/22/2008
	* The TestNetSrc functionality is now controlled by the symbol USE_TESTNETSRC.
	  Define it to enable the additional LT handshake between sink and source before completing the graph
	kdixon

Version 1.1.1.0
	12/17/2008
	* Added IPTZOverlayControl interface and PTZMoveRequestEventArgs
	* Implemeneted ClickToCenter as an overlay interface.
	kdixon

Version 1.1.0.0
	12/15/2008
	* Changed StreamViewerControl.B_Record from an FCClickButton to a Label
	  Mantis: 233
	* Changed to explicit versioning
	* Removed Win32.cs, replaced with reference to FutureConcepts.Utilities.Win32
	* Removed PreloadedSource.cs
	* Removed Delegates.cs
	kdixon
	
Version 1.0.*
	pre-12/15/2008
