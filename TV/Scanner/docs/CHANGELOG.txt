	  Mantis: 4656
	* Update installer to include Interop.LMNetSrc2 and Interop.LMNetDmx2 libraries from LT17
	  Mantis: 4659

	02/03/09
	* User settings and runtime generated data is now stored in C:\AntaresXData\Settings\TV Scanner\. This path
	  could dynamically change, since its based off of the GenericSettings.SaveDirectory property, which is
	  actually a wrapper around an environment varible.
	   - Only DeviceConfig.xml and the sounds\ directory are left in app_data
	  Mantis: 843
	01/30/09 - 02/02/09
	* Graphs that do their own channel scanning must implement Media.IChannelScanProvider.
	   - Otherwise descendents of TVGraphs.BaseLocalTuner can be scanned by TV.Scanner.ChannelScanner, which now
	     also implements Media.IChannelScanProvider
	* Network TV now supports doing a channel scan. If a channel scan is in progress when the user connects, they
	  are notified and the server will keep them updated on status.
	kdixon

	* Fixed problem where the app would explicitly set the channel to "2" when connecting to a remote server
	  Mantis: 826
	* Removed code where LTNetSource would register the MCastProtocol
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.6

	* Added additional error catching during the StartRecording/StopRecording process, mainly guards against missing
	  filter registrations
	  Mantis: 157
	kdixon

Version 10.17.2.4
	01/13/2009
	* Fixed problem where if there were 0 KnownChannels in the ATSCWinTV graph, tuning a channel would raise an exception
	  Mantis: 822

	  ATSCDataOnlyService and AnalogTelevision
	* Cleaned up app.config, removed commented-out info
	* Snapshot noise only plays when not muted
	* Show name of channel when tuning it (if available)
	  Mantis: 823
	* Thumbnails show name of channel (if available)
	* If a logical channel exists in favorites, then the user does a channel scan, all of the favorites information
	  will be updated from the latest channel info
	   - channels that are no-longer known can still be tuned if the user clicks the favorite, but nothing will show up.
	* If the user types numeric keys or the "-" "." or space keys, they will be interpreted as channel entry
	  Mantis: 482
	kdixon

	* Updated RenderCapture / Recording logic to avoid potential issues with non-WinTV graphs.
	* Added shortcuts to start menu
	  Mantis: 747
	* Implemented LEAD Audio Volume Filter to control volume and mute -- implemented at the BaseGraph level.

	* Changed startup flow. If an error occurs, the program exits, instead of presenting the configuration dialog.
	  - If Network TV fails to start up, the program launches anyway, so they can retry the connection by double-clicking the Network icon.
	* Start the program with the argument "config" to launch the configuration dialog. It is no longer accessable
	  via the button
	kdixon
