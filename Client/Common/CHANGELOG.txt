	  as well as the ChannelFactory
	kdixon

Version 1.3.0.3
	02/16/2010
	* QueryMediaServers now always loads the app.config QueryMediaServersConfigFile relative to the entry assembly
	  - absolute paths are not supported!
	kdixon

Version 1.3.0.2
	02/16/2010

	  - new property RemoveSelfFromOriginServers. When enabled (by default), removes servers appearing
	    in the Local advertisements from the incoming OriginServers lists.
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.3
	01/05/2010
	* Made AddressLookup class public
	kdixon

Version 1.2.0.2
	10/01/2009
	* QueryMediaServers class now supports StreamSourceInfo.Hidden property.

	  the proxy factory close cleanly. 
	  Mantis: 1456

	07/08/2009

	* Added some improvement to QueryMediaServers regarding how manually populated servers are handled.

	kdixon
