*** SVD CHANGELOG ***

Version 10.21.1.41
	* Add Elecard Audio Resampler filter to graph if the camera has audio
		and the pin type is PCM (uLaw or aLaw)

Version 10.21.1.40
	* Added logic to detect when user attempts to view a camera
		that is already being viewed.  In that case, SVD will
		ask the user if the existing viewer should be stopped.
		This will prevent multiple viewers viewing the same stream.
	Jira SVD-33

Version 10.21.1.38
	* Support various permutations of RTSP Source filters and H.264 Video Decoders
		a) Elecard RTSP Source with Microsoft H.264 Decoder (Windows 7)
		b) Elecard RTSP Source with Elecard H.264 Decoder (XP)
		c) LEADTOOLS RTSP Source and LEADTOOLS H.264 Decoder (for systems without Elecard filters)

Version 10.21.1.37
	* SUR-13: Implement audio support for Vivotek and AAC feeds.
		Required changes to VSM to add HasAudio column to sources table
			and support that all the way through to SVD.

Version 10.21.1.36
	* Fixes SUR-21: SVD PTZ Favorites not getting saved.  Removed
		PTZ Favorites control for Wonwoo cameras--it is not supported.

Version 10.21.1.35
	* Completed vivotek tunnel support and integration with VSM new camera control metadata

Version 10.21.1.34
	* in SVDMain this.HasControlBox = SystemInfo.DoCheck() was commented out
		and hardcoded to a value of true.  This enabled the maximize/minimize 
		buttons in SVD.  This is not the normal behavior with operating SVD
		with Command Console, so this code was fixed.  It required changed to 
		the Settings project which did not include the SystemInfo class.

Version 10.21.1.33
	* Possibly fixes SVD-25: NotifyMediaEvent wasn't processing all events in the queue only one.  
	* Improvements to streamViewer and graph Debug logging: all Debug output shows the Stream name (A, B, C, D)
		for the corresponding message.

Version 10.21.1.32
	* Fixes SVD-24 (camera list disappears for about 5 seconds)

Version 10.21.1.31
	* fixes SVD-13: Update SVD Command Console icons per Deanna

Version 10.21.1.30
	* fixes SVD-10: disappear sources list and strange GUI behavior/white screen, etc.

Version 10.21.1.29
	* fix bug in LocalSourceDiscovery.  Local Sources dragged to streamviewer were assumed to be BouncingBall.  Now use SourceType attribute
		from LocalSources.xml if it exists or default to RTSP.
	* fix issue where setup project custom action data was not set properly.  This was prevent SVD from showing in Command Console.

Version 10.21.1.28
	* Put back SinkProtocol in Profile.cs -- commenting-out this property was causing a compatibility issue
	* Fix bug in BaseGraph.NotifyMediaEvent that was call Marshal.FinalReleaseComObject() on a EventCode that is not a COM object
	* Fix issue with initialize PTZ control for legacy MediaServer 

Version 10.21.1.27
	12/26/2014
	* Remove (comment out) Vivotek support and CameraControl/Protocol which was not
		backwards compatible with legacy MediaServer.

Version 10.21.1.26
	9/18/2014
	* Fix crash when disposing the LEADTOOLS RTSP Source filter, then
		fix memory leaks in BaseGraph and RTSPGraph
	Jira SVD-8

Version 10.21.1.25
	9/16/2014
	* Fix LocalSourceDiscovery namespace issue
	* Support Elecard RTSP source types.  Specify SourceType="RTSP_Elecard" in LocalSources.xml
	* Support Wonwoo WWCA camera control type -- this might give the PTZ
		the behavior Ray was expecting

Version 10.21.1.24
	9/15/2014
	* Fix oops xml parse bug causing crash when trying to access PTZ

Version 10.21.1.23
	9/12/2014
	* Implemented support for controlling Wonwoo PTZ camera
		via Vivotek tunnel. This is one of the phases of the
		new surveyor.

Version 10.21.1.22
	3/26/2014
	* Change reconnect algorithm to this:
		rgibson@internal.futurec.net: after the first connect failure,
		try to reconnect an additional 4 times, waiting 2 seconds between each retry.
		After those have all failed, increase the delay to a new value (maybe 6 or 8 seconds)
		and leave it there indefinitely (8 seconds was chosen).
	* also don't show reconnect count to user
	* show different text during the pause before the reconnect (waiting...)

Version 10.21.1.21
	3/26/2014
	* Create AntaresXData/StaticSettings/SVD if it doesn't exist
	* Enable ProfileGroupSelector for LTSF sources
	* Disable ProfileGroupSelector for RTSP sources

Version 10.21.1.20
	3/26/2014
	* Fix break in RTSP sources--a bug introduced with the change from ClientURL to SinkAddress, etc.

Version 10.21.1.19
	3/26/2014
	* StreamSourceInfo now contains ONLY SinkAddress.  But, SVD will accept "ClientURL" or "SinkAddress" in LocalSources and VSM--both attributes
		are stored as SinkAddress and mean the same thing.

Version 10.21.1.18
	3/26/2014
	* Major changes.  Merged old media contract stuff (StreamSourceInfo, etc.) into new so that the latest SVD 
		will work with MediaServer 10.19.7.8.  We should not change these data structures going forward--they are gospel.

Version 10.21.1.17
	1/31/2014
	* Implemented new Source Discovery Configuration framework. 
		Source discovery plugins are now configured in C:\AntaresXData\StaticSettings\SVD\SourceDiscoveryConfiguration.xml
		If the configuration file does not exist, a default configuration will be created when SVD is run.
		The default configuration is this:
			- LocalSources using the C:\AntaresXData\StaticSettings\SVD\LocalSources.xml
			- Legacy NetMgr discovery
			- VSM discovery
			- IP Camera (attached local vehicle) discovery
		
Version 10.21.1.16
	1/29/2014
	* Added support for MPEG2-TS source types defined
		in LocalSources.XML.  This will be used to view multicast streams
		broadcast from the microwave receiver.  An example of a MPEG2-TS StreamSourceInfo is:
		<StreamSourceInfo Name="MicrowaveDownlink" SourceType="MPEG2_TS" Description="Dave's test MW" ClientURL="udp://@224.1.1.1:1234" />

Version 10.21.1.15
	1/6/2014
	* Added reconnect backoff algorithm to StreamViewer
		- previously, SVD would sleep 1 second between reconnect attempts
			now, the sleep between reconnect attempts increments by powers of 2:
				1 sec, 2 sec, 4, 8, 16, 32, until the max 32 is reached and then it stops trying.
	Mantis: 8978
	darnold

Version 10.21.1.14
	12/18/2013
	* Implemented LEADTOOLS RTSP Source filter bug/workaround
		by putting LEADTOOLS Video Callback filter in graph
		and setting an interval timer that fires and checks
		for a lost signal by the lack of any new video frames.
	Mantis: 8909

Version 10.21.1.13
	12/5/2013
	* fix version#
	Mantis: 8896

Version 10.21.1.12
	12/4/2013
	* Checkpoint build#1 for P260--netmgr/mango support

Version 10.21.1.11
	12/3/2013
	* Fix broken NetMgrSourceDiscovery--The StreamViewer couldn't handle a new
		discovery item dropped on it with the LTSFDeviceControl. 
	Mantis: 8889
	* If favorites.xml not found in AntaresXData, look in correct location
		in SVD/app_data/...
	  Needed to escape path because "\" was in the path.
	Mantis: 8888

Version 10.21.1.10
	11/21/2013
	* Set default VSM address to "http://10.200.0.245/online_sources.php"
	* Change recording file format to MPEG2 using the LEADTOOLS MPEG2 Multiplexer (2.0)
	Mantis: 8856

Version 10.21.1.9
	11/21/2013
	* Fix crash in PTZPalette client_propertyChanged(SavedCameraPositions)
		Created a public property for Store in UserPresetStore.  This class was
		recently decorated [DataContract] and the internal store was not exposed 
		for serialization.
	Mantis: 8849

Version 10.21.1.8
	11/21/2013
	* Put try/catch around SavedCameraPositions case in client_PropertyChanged
		in PTZPalette.cs line 294
		- note: with this change, saved ptz positions do not persist across restarts
			of SVD, but positions can be saved in one session
			It appears as though all saved positions are persisting correctly on the
			mediaserver, but when the mediaserver sends the positions to SVD,
			SVD thinks the saved positions are empty.
	* Moved location of where Favorites.xml and LocalSources.xml is found to:
		C:\AntaresXData\StaticSettings\SVD\
		- If favorites.xml is not found at location above it will look in <SVD_EXE>/app_data/...
	Mantis: 8840

Version 10.21.1.7
	11/20/2013
	* Fix the following crash in SVD when invalid saved positions are received from MediaServer:
		SVDMain camctl PropertyChanged SavedCameraPositions
		Exception! System.NullReferenceException:
		Message:Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
		StackTrace:
			at FutureConcepts.Media.UserPresetStore.get_Count()
			at FutureConcepts.Media.SVD.Controls.PTZPalette.client_PropertyChanged(Object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)
			
		Change Count getter in UserPresetStore to:
        public int Count
        {
            get
            {
                if (store == null)
                {
                    store = new Dictionary<Guid, UserPresetItem>();
                }
                return store.Count;
            }


Version 10.21.1.6
	11/19/2013
	* Override BaseGraph.Stop in RTSPGraph with empty implementation.
		This avoids sending a RTSP PAUSE
		which causes problems with the LEADTOOLS RTSP Source Filter with Grandstream rtsp server.
		- when a stream is stopped, the LT RTSP Source Filter sends a PAUSE (even
			if the RTSP server doesn't support PAUSE)
		- upon receiving the PAUSE, the Grandstream responds with:
			"RTSP/1.0 455 Method Not Valid In This State"
			CSeq: 4
			Server: GrandStream Rtsp Server V100R001
			Accept: OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, PLAY, TEARDOWN, SET_PARAMETER"
			(Note no PAUSE option)
		- the LT RTSP Source Filter appears to ignore the 455 error it keeps running
			and never stops.
		- The call in StreamViewer to IMediaControl.Stop() hangs forever
	Mantis: 8833

Version 10.21.1.5
	11/13/2013
	* Changes to work with the latest VSM for source discovery.
		- The URL to the VSM is configured in MediaAppSettings.fcs/VsmUrl

Version 10.21.1.4
	11/6/2013
	* Set default DiscoveryProtocols to "NetMgrSourceDiscovery"
	darnold

Version 10.21.1.3
	11/6/2013
	* Fix missing PTZ camera icon in the favorites treeview
	* Fix the following crash discovered by Cheryl:
		[2300] Exception! System.ArgumentNullException: 
		[2300]  Message:Value cannot be null. 
		[2300] Parameter name: hostOrIP 
		[2300]  StackTrace: 
		[2300]    at FutureConcepts.Media.Client.AddressLookup.GetHostEntry(String hostOrIP) 
		[2300]    at FutureConcepts.Media.Client.GraphControl..ctor(String serverAddress) 
		[2300]    at FutureConcepts.Media.Client.StreamViewer.DeviceControl.LTSFDeviceControl..ctor(StreamSourceInfo streamSourceInfo, String serverAddress) 
		[2300]    at FutureConcepts.Media.Client.StreamViewer.DeviceControl.DeviceControlFactory.Create(StreamSourceInfo streamSourceInfo, String serverAddress) 
		[2300]    at FutureConcepts.Media.Client.StreamViewer.StreamViewerControl.connectWorker_DoWork(Object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e) 
	darnold

Version 10.21.1.2
	11/4/2013
	* fix stream timeout limit for RTSP stream
	Mantis: 8774

Version 10.21.1.1
	11/4/2013
	* Major changes to SVD/MediaServer WCF contract.  Changes allow for forward/backward compatibility.
	* Fixed "The formatter threw an exception" error--SVD and MediaServer must be upgraded to
		version 10.21 together.
	Mantis: 8772

Version 10.20.1.9
	10/29/2013
	* Remove old UBNT discovery dead code.  This was hogging memory and causing slow startup.
	Mantis: 8543
	darnold

Version 10.20.1.8
	9/26/2013
	* New source stream discovery plugin framework with new plugins for the following discovery protocols:
		- MasterSourceDiscovery: This is a new discovery protocol that simply queries a web service that
			Joey is working on.  This protocol will primarly be used to define restreamed streams, such
			as Android AntaresX Broadcaster, IP Cameras and other restreamed sources.
        - WowzaSourceDiscovery: queries WOWZA for available sources--this probably won't be used since
			MasterSourceDiscovery will be the authoritative discovery protocol.
        - LocalSourceDiscovery: This plugin simply reads a local XML document (located in C:\AntaresXData\LocalSources.XML)
			the following is an example for the format for the document:
				<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
				<SourceGroups>
				  <SourceGroup Name="Dave's Group" Version="1" >
					<StreamSourceInfo Name="DaveSource" Description="Dave's Source" ClientURL="rtsp://10.0.20.1/mpeg/3" />
				  </SourceGroup>
				</SourceGroups>
        - NetMgrSourceDiscovery: this plugin is a wrapper around the legacy Netmanager/OLSRD video source discovery protocol

		To configure SVD to use any of the above protocols, define the <DiscoveryProtocols> tag in the following file:
			C:\AntaresXData\StaticSettings\MediaAppSettings.fcs

		The following is an example of MediaAppSettings.fcs:

			<Configuration xmlns="http://www.futureconcepts.com/AntaresX">
			  <Uncategorized>
				<Snapshots>C:\AntaresXData\Snapshots\</Snapshots>
				<Recordings>C:\AntaresXData\Recordings\</Recordings>
				<MapImages>C:\AntaresXData\MapImages\</MapImages>
				<TacticalPlanningExport>C:\AntaresXData\Output\Tactical Planning\Export\</TacticalPlanningExport>
				<UserName>SOFTWARE-06</UserName>
				<DiscoveryProtocols>MasterSourceDiscovery,LocalSourceDiscovery,NetMgrSourceDiscovery</DiscoveryProtocols>
			  </Uncategorized>
			</Configuration>

		The above sample configuration enables the MasterSourceDiscoveyr,LocalSourceDiscovery and the NetMgrSourceDiscovery
		protocols.

- Transcoder: Re-enabled support for overlay bitmap in trancoder.exe.

- Enhancements and improvements to DGProtocol (UDP) and SVD to detect when the client DirectShow graph stops running due to a lost connection to the server.
	This will solve the indefinite "hang" in SVD after the status changes from "Start Playing" to "Roundtrip".  It will also speedup the detection time.

10.3.0.42 - 2/7/2008

- Incorporated new local favorites graphics (PTZ, Conf, MW, Aux)
