Version 1.0.1.0
	05/20/2009
	* Fixed an issue where if the settings were invoked at the wrong time, then the filter would stop passing frames
	* This fix also makes changes between framerates better for the user.
	  - For example, if you are at 1fpm, then change to 60fpm, a frame will be passed within 1 second of the
	    paramter change occuring.
